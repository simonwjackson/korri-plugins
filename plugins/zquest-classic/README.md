# ZQuest Classic

`@simonwjackson:zquest-classic` runs unpacked `.qst` files with the native
ZQuest Classic player on Linux x86_64 and aarch64. It does not include the
quest editor, a quest downloader, or automatic game registration.

## Source and integration

The engine pin, dependency pins, and ARM tile-rendering patch come from
Korri's read-only `legacy` branch at
`product/plugins/zquest-classic/packages/zquest-classic/`.
The source is [ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic at
882c906b17e35b4105188e6305ae2929aeba30e3](https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/tree/882c906b17e35b4105188e6305ae2929aeba30e3),
from June 18, 2026. This is a development snapshot, not a claim to package
the latest stable release. Quests that require later engine changes can fail.

The system identity `zelda-classic`, title `Zelda Classic Quest`, runner name
`zplayer`, `.qst` discovery extension, and `-standalone` launch mode preserve
legacy's producer. The publisher changes to this repository's existing
`@simonwjackson` namespace. There is no alias for the old publisher.

The source declaration performs no effects. It returns the approved launcher,
the literal quest path, and an account-owned state directory. Core performs the
launch under its existing policy. No Core schema or permission expansion is
required. Unsupported launch overrides and libretro cores are rejected.

Build machines compile the native player from a cleaned source tree. Devices
receive prebuilt outputs. Both architectures use the ZScript interpreter,
following the legacy package.
The ARM patch selects upstream's scalar tile renderer instead of x86 SIMD.
This costs performance for script-heavy quests. The package disables the
updater, WebSocket scripting, and native file-dialog dependency.

The native `allegro.cfg` selects Allegro's built-in DIGMID software synthesizer.
Its patch index is generated from FreePats' existing `crude.cfg` mappings.
This avoids upstream's ALSA MIDI autodetection crash when `/dev/snd/seq` is
absent, as on the Mini V2. It keeps sound effects and music enabled without
a new device service or kernel change. FreePats adds about 33 MiB and uses
substitute or omitted instruments where its tone bank is incomplete. The original
FreePats license and mapping remain in the closure.

`sound-thread-timeout.patch` initializes the legacy audio worker's timeout
before each wait, matching its keyboard, mouse, timer, and joystick workers.
The original worker passed an uninitialized timeout. Sound-enabled ARM checks
exposed stalls that the original muted checks did not cover.

## Public resource build

The `public1` package contains no bundled quest, NSF soundtrack, original
sound bank, or original bitmap-font collection. It does not clear the rights
to quests supplied by users. The publication audit is in
[docs/research/zquest-publication-audit.md](../../docs/research/zquest-publication-audit.md).

| Resource | Public build behavior |
|---|---|
| Default sound effects | 61 original generated cues keep the existing numeric sound slots. They do not imitate the original game recordings. |
| Default MIDI music | Seven valid silent tracks satisfy the native loader. Quest-provided music still plays. |
| Runtime fonts | ProggyVector-derived raster fonts retain measured character widths and line heights. Special game alphabets are not reproduced. |
| Native menus and ending | Original geometric markers and neutral completion text replace the stock presentation. User quest content is not changed. |
| Old quests without embedded tiles | Rejected with a missing-default-tiles explanation instead of loading stock artwork or displaying broken graphics. |
| Optional editor/example material | Not included in the runtime resources. |

The separately licensed ZQuest Commons logo, icon and theme music remain with
their terms and credits. ProggyVector remains for the debugger with its font
license. FreePats remains the software MIDI instrument bank. Resource generation,
format requirements and notices are in [ASSET-LICENSES.md](ASSET-LICENSES.md).

The player sounds and looks different from upstream. Unusual script glyphs can
lose meaning when replaced with licensed generic glyphs. The resource checks
validate their format and origin inputs, not every community quest's layout.

## Saves and configuration

The owner selected account-owned storage and content-hash save identity on
2026-10-02. State resides beneath `${input.accountRoot}/zquest-classic`,
following the existing Zelda3 account-storage pattern.

The launcher hashes the complete quest with SHA-256, as Core's file scanner
already does. It passes `sha256:<digest>.sav` as upstream's explicit standalone
save filename. There is one native save slot per quest release per account.

| Native path inside the account directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `zc.cfg` and `controls.cfg` | The player writes its native configuration and control schemes. |
| `saves/sha256:<digest>.sav` | The native standalone save for these exact quest bytes. |
| `saves/backup/` | The player keeps its native save backups here. |
| `replays/` and `allegro.log` | Upstream replay and diagnostic output remains account-owned. |
| Shipped resource names such as `assets/`, `modules/`, and `base_config/` | Links to immutable resources in the exact installed package. |

Moving or renaming a quest retains its save. A narrow engine patch makes
standalone mode use the newly selected path when loading an existing save.
Different quests with the same filename get different saves. Updating quest
bytes produces a separate save. Moving an older save to an updated quest is
an explicit user operation and depends on that quest's save compatibility.

The launcher holds a directory lock across native execution. A second session
for the same account fails rather than sharing configuration and saves.
Package updates refresh resource links. The launcher refuses to replace local
files or foreign links at those resource names. Edit `zc.cfg` while the player
is stopped. Changing upstream's `save_folder` setting changes where it writes
saves.

## Handheld settings

The owner chose these launcher settings on 2026-10-02. The launcher writes
them into the account's native files before every start. It changes only the
named keys and keeps every other line.

| Setting | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `-fullscreen` | command line | The player fills the screen. Upstream starts windowed. It overrides `fullscreen` in `zc.cfg`. |
| `replay_upload_prompt = 1` | `zc.cfg`, `[zeldadx]` | Upstream's upload question is marked as asked. `replay_upload` keeps its value; upstream's default is off. The plugin does not consent for the user. |
| `clicktofreeze = 0` | `zc.cfg`, `[zeldadx]` | A touch or click does not open the system menu. |
| `btn_menu = 0` | every scheme in `controls.cfg` except `Default` | The gamepad menu button does not open the system menu. |
| `joystick_index` | the same schemes | Selects `Korri Seat P1`, where Korri sends the device's own controls. |

Upstream resets the `Default` scheme on every start, so it cannot hold these
keys. When the global scheme is `Default` or missing, the launcher selects
`Custom`, the scheme upstream creates on its own first start.

Allegro numbers joysticks in unsorted `/dev/input` order. On the Mini V2 that
made the newest seat, `Korri Seat P4`, joystick 0, so the player ignored the
pad. The launcher repeats Allegro's joystick test to find the seat's index.
Without a Korri seat it leaves `joystick_index` unchanged.

The system menu is the player's only in-game route to settings and to ending
the game. Korri stops the session instead. The Escape key still opens the menu,
because upstream hard-codes it; this matters only with a keyboard attached. A
quest-specific scheme that names `Default` also keeps the menu button.

Existing `/storage/saves/zquest-classic` data remains untouched. There is no
fallback read, dual write, or automatic migration from legacy.

Keep companion music files beside the quest as its author specifies. Archives
must be unpacked before discovery. Do not modify a quest while it is running.
Normal signature and permission checks remain required.

## Build and verify

Run from this repository on a build machine:

```sh
nix build --no-link .#packages.x86_64-linux.korri-plugin-zquest-classic
nix build --no-link .#packages.aarch64-linux.korri-plugin-zquest-classic
nix build --no-link .#checks.x86_64-linux.korri-zquest-classic-plugin
nix build --no-link .#checks.aarch64-linux.korri-zquest-classic-plugin
```

The checks exercise the real manifest, strict launch types, host admission,
and production sandboxed callback. They run the packaged player through Core
on Xvfb, using an original generated geometric room rather than an upstream
template or retail data. They exercise
keyboard input, native screenshots, in-game save writes, reload after a rename,
separate accounts, changed-release isolation, concurrent-session refusal, and
preservation of local files. Test accounts do not answer the upload question,
so a launcher regression stops the run at upstream's modal. The checks assert
the exact handheld-settings edits and that the player keeps them on exit.
They also assert upstream's `auto_scopes.zplay` against the pinned interpreter.
Only 26 graphics hashes change for the public fonts. All upstream script
traces, RNG, controls and timing remain exact. Its Git LFS files are fetched
by hash for tests only and are absent from the plugin closure.
The native asset reader checks all 61 samples, 101 font slots/metrics, seven
silent MIDI tracks and two bitmaps. It exercises the real MIDI timer at each
default loop boundary. The original win-room variant exercises the ending,
acknowledgement, save write, backup and return to the quest.
A private PulseAudio null sink exercises real sound initialization without
hardware or an ALSA sequencer. These checks do not establish audible output,
physical-controller support, all-quest compatibility, or device acceptance.
The cleaned public player checks passed on native x86_64 and aarch64 build
machines on 2026-10-03.
The check-only GitHub workflow runs both architectures and publishes nothing.

For an interactive run with separate test state:

```sh
nix run .#zquest-classic -- /path/to/quest.qst /path/to/test-state
```

## Publication and installation

The output contains the reviewed and generated runtime resources described
above, plus license notices. It omits the editor and all bundled quests.
Upstream declares GPLv3 for the project. The `public1` recipe selects
reviewed runtime resources before compilation and provides generated replacements. A successful build alone does not prove
asset rights. The publication gate checks the final resource inventory and
compares every generated file with its source derivation. The release process
also checks the exact runtime closure and corresponding-source archives.

### Corresponding source

```sh
nix build --no-link .#packages.x86_64-linux.zquest-classic-source
nix build --no-link .#packages.aarch64-linux.zquest-classic-source
```

These outputs contain architecture-specific source archives with the cleaned
engine, explicit CMake dependency sources, generator inputs/notices, and a
standalone Nix recipe. They exclude upstream quest/media collections and
unneeded dependency demo/test media. `BUILDING.txt` explains rebuilding from
the extracted source. Source archives and exact `revision.txt`/architecture
path lists accompany the binary release. The original integration recipes are
also in this repository at that revision.

### Signed cache publication

[Public release and verification record](../../docs/deployments/2026-10-03-zquest-public-release.md)
identifies the exact published outputs, corresponding source and device-test
limits. Both source archives and signed payloads are public.

Public destination: `https://github.com/simonwjackson/korri-plugins/releases/download/cache/`.
Publish only the exact checked ZQuest plugin outputs, never all flake packages,
a build/test closure, or a copy of the private cache. Each batch uses its own
source tag and the existing standard Korri GitHub binary-cache publisher.
Upload corresponding source before publishing its binary batch.

Publisher binding is separate from publication. An existing device bound to
the private cache does not automatically trust a different cache URL. This
release does not change device bindings or bypass signature/approval checks.

## Device installation

[Deployment evidence](../../docs/deployments/2026-10-02-zquest-miniv2.md)
records verified private signed-cache installation and runtime-user unprivileged
smoke execution on the Retroid Pocket Mini V2 on 2026-10-02.

Signed publication and device installation require their existing approvals.
Do not build on a device or bypass publisher trust to install this package.
After publishing the architecture-specific output through an approved signed
cache, use Core's existing exact-package approval flow:

```sh
sudo korri-plugin inspect "$CACHE_URL" "$PACKAGE"
# Review the report, then set APPROVAL to its exact digest.
sudo korri-plugin install "$CACHE_URL" "$PACKAGE" "$APPROVAL"
sudo korri-plugin enable @simonwjackson:zquest-classic
```
